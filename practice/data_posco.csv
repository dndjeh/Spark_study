"Hyundai, POSCO join hands on U.S. steel mill amid trade pressure"," Hyundai Motor Group and POSCO Group have agreed to jointly build a steel mill in the United States. Hyundai Steel, South Korea’s second-largest steelmaker and an affiliate of Hyundai Motor, had earlier announced plans to invest $5.8 billion (8.23 trillion won) to construct a mill in Louisiana. In a rare move, POSCO, the country’s largest steelmaker, has decided to participate in the project. The two groups have had a long and often tense relationship as business partners in the automotive steel supply chain, frequently clashing over prices and terms. With the founding of Hyundai Steel, they also became fierce competitors as the top two steelmakers in South Korea. However, amid the increasingly protectionist trade policies of U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, including steep tariffs, the two rivals have chosen cooperation over competition.  Both groups held a signing ceremony at Hyundai’s headquarters in Seoul on April 21 for a memorandum of understanding on mutual cooperation in the steel and battery materials sectors. The agreement includes joint investment in the U.S. steel plant and collaboration in core materials for electric vehicle batteries. Specifics such as investment amounts, ownership stakes, and conditions were not disclosed. The companies said discussions on investment terms are ongoing. Hyundai previously announced it would fund the 8 trillion won ($5.6 billion) project with a 50:50 split between equity and loans from financial institutions. About half of the equity—around 2 trillion won—is to be provided by Hyundai affiliates, with the remainder raised through external investment. POSCO is now joining the project as a key partner. This partnership allows Hyundai to secure funding while spreading risk. Although Hyundai last month pledged a massive 31 trillion won investment during a joint announcement with Trump at the White House, the steel mill alone carries a heavy financial burden and uncertain returns. Industry watchers have voiced concerns that low utilization rates or shifts in market conditions could hinder profitability, despite plans to use the steel for Hyundai’s U.S. manufacturing. For POSCO, the deal secures a strategic foothold in North America. Chairman Chang In-hwa, who took office last year, has repeatedly expressed his ambition to build a local steel production base in the U.S., but had made little headway until now. By acquiring a stake in Hyundai Steel’s U.S. project, POSCO moves closer to realizing this goal. With 6.77 trillion won in cash reserves as of the end of last year, POSCO Holdings is financially well-equipped. The companies added that they are discussing further options, such as POSCO taking part of the plant’s output for its own sales. For many years, POSCO (formerly Pohang Iron and Steel), the sole steel producer in South Korea, was a key supplier for Hyundai, which relied heavily on steel for automotive production. Seeking to break free from this dependency, Hyundai founder Chung Ju-yung made a strong push in the 1970s to establish a “second steel mill.” However, POSCO’s strong opposition thwarted this attempt, and the site ultimately became what is now the Gwangyang Steelworks. Even after that, whenever Hyundai tried to gain steel independence, POSCO continued to block their efforts, refusing to supply steel and even challenging patents. The rivalry has now taken a dramatic turn toward cooperation.",2025. 4. 22. 09:08,http://v.daum.net/v/20250422090820526
"Hyundai, POSCO set aside rivalry with US steel, battery tie-up","South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Group and POSCO Group said on April 21 they have signed a partnership to cooperate in steelmaking and battery materials, expanding their alliance as trade risks grow under U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration. Hyundai, the country’s third-largest business group by assets, and POSCO, its fifth, are strengthening ties as Washington ramps up tariff threats, industry sources said. Under the agreement, POSCO will invest in Hyundai’s planned electric arc furnace steel mill in the United States. Hyundai previously announced a $5.8 billion project to build the plant in Louisiana, with an annual capacity of 2.7 million tonnes, and said roughly half of the investment would come from external sources. POSCO will now participate as a co-investor, though details such as its stake and financial commitment were not disclosed.  The companies said investment terms remain under discussion, with options including POSCO directly marketing a portion of the steel produced at the site. POSCO said the deal would help it secure a foothold in the North American steel market, which has faced protectionist trade barriers for more than a decade. Beyond steel, the groups plan to cooperate in electric vehicle battery materials, aiming to diversify and stabilize supply chains for key secondary battery components while exploring long-term opportunities in next-generation materials. POSCO said it would leverage its competitiveness in battery materials — from lithium to cathodes and anodes — alongside Hyundai’s clean mobility technologies to build a sustainable partnership. The deal marks a shift in relations between the two industrial heavyweights, who have often been rivals since Hyundai entered the steel business more than 20 years ago. At one point, tensions escalated to the extent that POSCO reportedly refused to supply automotive steel sheets to Hyundai. But mounting trade pressure from Washington has pushed the former competitors to realign as partners. “Though the two firms remain fierce rivals in the market, they have shown a willingness to set aside differences for practical benefits,” an industry official said. POSCO said the partnership reflects ongoing discussions since Chairman Chang In-hwa took office last year. “By combining our strengths, we can find sustainable growth solutions in steel and battery materials as global trade challenges and industrial shifts accelerate,” said Lee Ju-tae, POSCO Holdings President, at the signing ceremony in Seoul.",2025. 4. 21. 16:00,http://v.daum.net/v/20250421160024424
Steel rivals join hands: Posco invests in Hyundai steel mill in face of tariff risk," Hyundai Motor Group and Posco Group signed a memorandum of understanding to deepen cooperation in steelmaking and secondary battery materials as both companies seek to adapt to shifting trade dynamics spurred by rising U.S. tariffs on steel and autos. The two conglomerates announced the agreement on Monday following a signing ceremony at Hyundai’s headquarters in southern Seoul. Han Seok-won, executive vice president and head of strategy and planning at Hyundai Motor Group, and Lee Joo-tae, president and head of future strategy at Posco Holdings, attended the event. The partnership centers on joint investment and production at a new electric arc furnace steel mill Hyundai is building in Louisiana. The $5.8 billion project aims to produce 2.7 million tons of hot-rolled and cold-rolled steel annually, primarily for use in automotive manufacturing. Posco will co-invest in the project, helping Hyundai secure about half the external funding required. The two sides are still negotiating the exact equity structure. Hyundai Steel, the group's steelmaking affiliate, will supply steel produced at the facility to Hyundai's and Kia’s U.S. plants, as well as those of other global carmakers. Posco is in discussions to secure a portion of the output for its own sales in the region. The move allows Posco to establish a production foothold in the United States without having to build a full-scale steel mill. The group currently operates processing centers in the United States and an automotive steel plant in Mexico but lacks primary production capabilities in the region. Since taking the helm last year, Posco Group Chairman and CEO Chang In-hwa has emphasized localized, end-to-end production as a strategic priority. The partnership with Hyundai reportedly gained momentum after discussions between Chang and Hyundai Motor Group Executive Chair Euisun Chung in the second half of last year.  The two groups also plan to expand collaboration in the secondary battery supply chain, including lithium and anode materials — key ingredients in electric vehicle batteries. Posco currently produces lithium hydroxide in Argentina and Korea and manufactures battery-grade cathodes and anodes in Pohang, North Gyeongsang, and Gwangyang, South Jeolla, as well as China and Canada under its subsidiary Posco Future M. Hyundai said the agreement would help secure essential raw materials in response to shifting global supply chains and tightening trade regulations mandated by the United States and European Union. Hyundai and Posco will also seek opportunities to cooperate in developing next-generation materials, exploring areas where the two industrial giants can generate synergy over the long term.

POSCO Future M to invest $277 mn to build spherical graphite plant," The company announced Tuesday that its board approved the investment, with construction expected to begin in the second half of 2025 and mass production likely to start around 2027. This investment is part of POSCO Group’s broader strategy to achieve supply chain independence - from sourcing natural flake graphite from Africa to manufacturing final anode materials at its plant in Sejong, South Korea. The new domestic facility will refine the African-sourced flake graphite into spherical graphite, which will then be used to produce natural graphite-based anode materials. The move is expected to significantly reduce reliance on overseas suppliers - particularly China - and lower risks associated with material price volatility and supply instability. Until now, POSCO Future M had depended on imports from China for spherical graphite. With the global anode market rapidly expanding, the establishment of a stable, self-sufficient, and cost-effective supply chain is set to be a critical factor in ensuring profitability and competitiveness. “By creating a fully integrated value chain from African mines to domestic production, we have secured a key competitive edge in our anode materials business. This investment lays the foundation for sustainable growth in the global battery materials market,” a company official said.",2025. 4. 23. 11:03,http://v.daum.net/v/20250423110328137
POSCO to co-invest in Hyundai’s EAF steel mill in U.S.," Hyundai Motor and POSCO signed a business agreement on Monday in Seoul to collaborate in the fields of steel and secondary batteries. POSCO has agreed to invest in the EAF Hyundai Steel Co. plans to build in Louisiana by 2029. The facility will have an annual production capacity of 2.7 million tons. The total investment is estimated at $5.8 billion, with Hyundai planning to raise half from external investors. Through its stake in the project, POSCO aims to secure a U.S.-based production base and avoid the 25 percent steel tariffs imposed by the U.S. In secondary batteries, the conglomerates plan to build a stable supply chain to better respond to the global EV market slowdown. POSCO’s lithium sourcing and POSCO Future M Co.’s strength in cathode and anode materials will complement Hyundai’s eco-friendly mobility technologies. The tie-up between Korea’s No. 1 and No. 2 steelmakers is a rare move in a typically competitive sector. The partnership aims to bypass rising U.S. tariff barriers in the short term and reduce reliance on China’s rare mineral supply chains in the long term. Experts say increasing industrial complexity and geopolitical tension are accelerating corporate alliances. The joint investment is largely driven by the 25 percent tariffs on steel and automobiles promoted by U.S. President Donald Trump. Earlier this month, Hyundai Motor Group announced plans to build a Louisiana plant that will produce 2.7 million tons of automotive steel annually, with commercial production targeted for 2029. The steel will be supplied first to Hyundai Motor and Kia Corp. factories in the U.S. POSCO expects to meet demand from Hyundai and Kia through the investment. It is also considering supplying other U.S. automakers. The size of POSCO’s stake in the project is still under discussion. A prolonged downturn in the global steel industry also influenced the decision. Both conglomerates face pressure from Chinese oversupply, weak domestic demand due to a construction slowdown, and tighter carbon regulations in developed markets such as the European Union. The battery partnership reflects a longer-term strategy, as battery technology emerges as a key driver of competitiveness in the EV era. Hyundai is researching next-generation batteries, including solid-state cells, and is reportedly considering in-house production over the medium to long term. “Supply chain diversification for rare earths is one of Hyundai’s core objectives,” said an industry official.",2025. 4. 22. 10:54,http://v.daum.net/v/20250422105404189
"Posco, Hyundai sign MOU on joint investment in $5.8 billion Louisiana steel mill project"," Posco and Hyundai Motor Group on Monday signed a deal that will see Korea’s top steelmaker jointly invest in the automaker’s steel mill in Louisiana, to secure tariff-exempt supply chains and cooperate on carbon-neutral EV technology. Under the memorandum of understanding (MOU), Posco will invest an undisclosed amount into Hyundai Motor’s steel factory that the carmaker had recently announced it will use $5.8 billion to construct, according to Posco Holdings on Monday. This marks Posco’s entry into the United States, which has been barred by trade protectionism. The firm currently does not operate any steel production facilities in the country and supplies carmakers in the area through metal processing centers, such as its automotive steel plant in Mexico. Posco expects the U.S. location to allow it to efficiently supply materials within the United States and to Mexico, giving the firm the choice of flexible production and sales, the steelmaker said in a statement. The two groups also plan to cooperate on developing sustainable materials by incorporating Posco’s battery materials and Hyundai Motor’s eco-friendly mobility technology. The two firms discussed the agreement since last year in anticipation of the shifting secondary battery market and to realize Posco's localization strategy in high-growth overseas steel markets, Posco said.  Executives including Han Seok-won, executive vice president and head of strategy and planning at Hyundai Motor Group, and Posco Holdings President Lee Joo-tae were present at the MOU signing at Hyundai Motor’s offices on Monday. “By leveraging the synergy between the two companies, we can find sustainable growth solutions across our entire business portfolio, including steel and secondary battery materials, amid global trade pressure and shifting industry paradigms,” Lee said through the firm’s statement. Hyundai Motor Group Executive Chair Euisun Chung announced in March that the firm will invest $21 billion in U.S. facilities including the Louisiana steel mill and Hyundai Motor’s Georgia plant as well as in renewable energy initiatives and EV charging infrastructure in the United States to avoid potential tariffs and automobile duties. The Louisiana electric steel plant that Posco will jointly invest in is planned to finish construction by 2029 and have an annual production capacity of 2.7 million tons, with a specialization in auto steel plates.

"New alliances: Hyundai, Posco team up on steel, batteries to tackle US tariffs"," Hyundai Motor Group and Posco Group, longtime industry rivals, have joined forces in a strategic alliance abroad, specifically in the US, a key market pressured by steep 25 percent tariffs on steel and automobiles. Hyundai Motor said Monday that it aims to create synergy with the steelmaker by securing a supply chain for key raw materials for electric vehicle batteries. Meanwhile, Posco seeks to create a foothold in the North American market, where the auto giant plans to set up a new auto steel facility. Earlier in the day, executives from both companies, including Han Seok-won, head of the planning and coordination division at Hyundai Motor Group and Lee Joo-tae, head of the future strategy division at Posco Holdings, attended the signing ceremony for the partnership agreement at Hyundai Motor Group’s Seoul headquarters in Gangnam. As part of the steel alliance, Posco Group is considering investing a stake in Hyundai Steel, Hyundai Motor’s steel manufacturing arm’s electric arc furnace manufacturing plant in Louisiana and exploring ways to directly sell the partial production volume. The $5.8 billion facility, set to start commercial operations by 2029, has the annual capacity to manufacture 2.7 million metric tons of hot and cold-rolled auto steel sheets. Posco intends to leverage the strategic location of the production base -- which is near Hyundai Motor’s Alabama plant, Kia’s Georgia plant and the newly opened Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America in Georgia -- to supply Hyundai, Kia and other US automakers. Aiming to sell over 3.26 million battery-powered vehicles annually by 2030, Hyundai Motor plans to secure key rechargeable battery supply chains in partnership with Posco. The steelmaker’s subsidiaries, including Posco International and Posco Future M, produce lithium hydroxide and anode and cathode materials for EV batteries by sourcing lithium resources through ownership and equity investments in overseas salt lakes and mines. Hyundai Motor stressed the importance of establishing a stable and diversified supply chain for battery raw materials amid the escalating geopolitical risks -- volatile trade policies and supply chain restructuring in the US, EU and other regions. “Through the strategic partnership with Posco Group, we will expand business opportunities in global markets, including the US, while solidifying the foundation for sustainable growth and leadership in electrification within the future mobility sector,” stated a Hyundai Motor Group official. The carmaker also hinted at an R&D partnership for next-generation battery materials. While it did not disclose specifics, it was reported that Hyundai Motor, which has set up a pilot production line for all-solid-state batteries, is considering sourcing the battery materials from Posco. Experts say that the unprecedented alliance between Posco and Hyundai Steel, South Korea’s top 1 and 2 steelmakers, signals an all-hands-on-deck response to counteract the 25 percent tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump. “This partnership marks a significant shift from the traditional competition between the two companies,” said Kim De-jong, a business professor at Sejong University. “Although Posco has held a stronger foothold in the steel industry, its willingness to work with Hyundai Steel shows that desperate times call for desperate measures. Joining hands with its rivals is ironically the only viable option for Korean companies to improve the cost efficiency of relocating their production facilities to the US.” Notably, Posco, which operates two steel processing sites in Alabama and Indiana, has long mulled over constructing a steel mill that handles upstream processes from melting raw steel to producing intermediate products in the US. Its previous plan for a hot and cold-rolled plant in Alabama was scrapped due to high labor costs. For Hyundai Steel, Posco’s stake investment is a lifeline as it faces cost pressures from the Louisiana project. Considering that Hyundai Steel’s cash and cash equivalents were approximately 1.3 trillion won ($917 million) at the end of last year, the company would be allocating nearly all of its cash reserves to this Louisiana project, which reportedly requires 1 trillion - 2 trillion won from the steelmaker. To secure funding for the US base, it recently began negotiations with Dongkuk Steel, Korea’s third-largest steel manufacturer, to sell off Hyundai IFC, its steel forging subsidiary.",2025. 4. 21. 14:54,http://v.daum.net/v/20250421145445418
"[Minute to Read] Hyundai, POSCO join forces to tackle Trump tariffs","The Minute to Read (Weekdays) series provides a quick overview of significant events in Korea everyday, conveniently condensed into a one-minute read. Here’s a recap of what happened yesterday: Apr. 22.  Hyundai, POSCO join forces to tackle Trump tariffs Hyundai Motor Group and POSCO Group have agreed to jointly build a $5.8 billion steel mill in Louisiana, marking a rare collaboration between South Korea’s two largest steelmakers. The partnership also includes collaboration on electric vehicle battery materials. This move comes amid rising U.S. trade protectionism, with both companies seeking to strengthen their positions in North America. Despite their history of rivalry, the agreement reflects a shift toward cooperation. S. Korean firms among top donors to Trump’s inauguration Samsung Electronics quietly donated $315,000 to U.S. President Donald Trump’s January inauguration via its U.S. subsidiary, joining Hyundai, Hanwha, and Coupang among major Korean firms contributing to the record $239 million raised. With foreign entities barred from donating directly, Korean companies funneled support through their U.S. arms, aligning with global tech and industry giants also backing Trump’s second term. Hanwha Aerospace boosts European presence with local production Hanwha Aerospace is accelerating its European expansion by setting up local production in Poland and Romania. The company will produce guided missiles and K9 howitzers to meet growing EU demands for domestically made defense systems.

POSCO International to introduce its first LNG carrier in May," According to industry sources on Tuesday, the South Korean trading and energy company will take delivery of a 174,000-cubic-meter LNG vessel built by HD Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries in May 2025. The ship will be capable of transporting enough LNG to meet Korea’s nationwide energy demand for about half a day. POSCO International initially plans to deploy the vessel for LNG trading and will use the vessel to import LNG directly from North America to South Korea from 2026 onwards. This is the first time POSCO International is acquiring its own LNG carrier. The company previously focused on upstream operations such as developing and producing gas at sites like the Myanmar gas field and typically sold natural gas via pipelines, which minimized the need for dedicated transport vessels. However, with global demand for LNG expected to rise – particularly under U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration - POSCO International placed a growing importance in securing its own shipping capacity. The new LNG carrier will play a key role in delivering North American gas, which the company will begin importing directly from 2026. The company has already signed a long-term agreement with U.S.-based Cheniere Energy to import 400,000 tons of LNG annually for 20 years starting in 2026. “A self-operated LNG vessel allows us to manage LNG transportation and trading more efficiently,” a company official said. “We plan to introduce additional LNG carriers moving forward to strengthen our midstream infrastructure even further.” POSCO Group has identified LNG as a next-generation business and has been accelerating its integration of the LNG full value chain. POSCO International has expanded its upstream business through resource exploration and production since beginning gas field development in Myanmar in 2000. The company finalized its merger with POSCO Energy in 2023, expanding its operations to include midstream (storage) and downstream (power generation) capabilities to complete its LNG value chain strategy.",2025. 4. 16. 10:24,http://v.daum.net/v/20250416102429516
POSCO considers investing in Hyundai Steel’s U.S. plant," According to the steel industry on Sunday, POSCO Group is reviewing potential participation as a financial investor in Hyundai Steel’s electric arc furnace steel mill planned for construction in Louisiana. Hyundai Steel announced last month that it would invest around $5.8 billion to build the plant in Donaldsonville, Louisiana, with an annual production capacity of 2.7 million tons. The company aims to begin commercial operations by 2029, funding half the investment with its own capital and the remainder through external borrowing. POSCO Group’s possible involvement has drawn attention, as local production in the U.S. is seen as one of the few viable ways to avoid the 25 percent steel tariffs imposed under President Trump. POSCO has also been actively exploring U.S.-based production strategies. During the group’s 57th anniversary speech last month, POSCO Group Chairman Chang In-hwa highlighted the importance of “locally integrated investments” in high-growth, high-margin steel markets, naming the U.S. and India. His remarks are seen as a call for upstream investments to build a fully localized production system that can better respond to regional demand. If POSCO and Hyundai Steel join forces in the U.S. project, it would mark the first time domestic rivals have teamed up to tackle U.S. steel tariffs through joint local production. However, uncertainties remain. POSCO is reportedly considering not only financial investment but also securing part of the plant’s output—effectively taking a stake in the production line. While Hyundai Steel is open to outside investment, it may be cautious about yielding control over its production operations. “We are reviewing various strategies with regard to U.S. investment but no decisions have been made as of now,” said an official from POSCO.",2025. 4. 14. 11:30,http://v.daum.net/v/20250414113024354
